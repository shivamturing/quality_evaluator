## Available Tool Definitions
{tool_definitions}

## Allowed Tools (Names Only)
{allowed_tools}

## Expected Tools

## Happy Path Steps (Trainer's Gold Standard Execution)
{happy_path_steps}

## Auto-Detected Flags
{detected_flags}

Please evaluate this Happy Path against the four criteria:
1. **Tool Selection**: Are the correct tools used for the task?
2. **Parameter Accuracy**: Are all parameters accurate with no fabricated values?
3. **Logical Dependency**: Are steps in the correct order (dependencies first)?
4. **State Change**: Does the execution achieve the complete goal?

Scoring rules:
- Use a numeric score from **0 to 5** in **0.5** increments.
- **5** means the criterion fully meets all pass conditions.
- **0** means the criterion completely fails.
- Set `overall_score` to the **minimum** of the four criterion scores.
- Set `overall_pass` to **true only if** `overall_score` is **5**.

Pay special attention to:
- Magic IDs (IDs used before retrieval)
- Redundant tool calls
- Missing steps for complete task resolution
